Create a Python script that is mainly a PyTorch module(Called PtModule) with some math operations and a for loop, do not use layers as we are not interested in neural operations. create an array of potential input array(called input_tensors) of 5 inputs that is larger that is 3 to 4 dimension, the tensors has to be declared with their value, outside the module.  Also add a simple main section can run the script just to check if this script is runnable. These will mainly be accessed from other scripts.
