### 3. Test Different Operation Combination for Performance Comparisons

1. Create multiple random tensors to perform operations on.
2. Test different sequences using +, -, *, /, and torch.add(), torch.sub(), torch.mul(), torch.div().
3. Use torch.cuda.synchronize() (for GPU) and timeit to record execution time.
4. Use PyTorch Inductor to check whether fused operations run faster.


Improvement Updates:

- Run each operation 10,000 times.
- Discard the first few runs (typically the first 10â€“100) to eliminate warm-up effects.
- Compute the average execution time for better accuracy.
