### Equivalent Operators in PyTorch Optimization Testing

- Do test generations from colab to VScode: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

1. Execution Time Results Between Operations
  - Addition & Substraction & Multiplication & Division
  
2. Background
  - Operation Fusion in PyTorch
  - Loop Optimization
  - Expression Optimization (+, torch.sub, *, torch.div)
  - PyTorch Inductor Optimizations

3. Test Different Operation Combination for Performance Comparisons
4. Compare the performance with and without torch.compile()
